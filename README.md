# Utils
Just a random set of very simple utility apps:
- [Process WebSphere Portal Export](https://github.com/Simone3/Utils/raw/master/utils/Process%20WebSphere%20Portal%20Export.jar): the WebSphere Portal allows to export a page into an XML. This util parses that XML to remove ID references and to add/change some permission elements and attributes.
- [Rename Files From List](https://github.com/Simone3/Utils/raw/master/utils/Rename%20Files%20From%20List.jar): this util renames a set of files given a list of new file names.
- [Zip Files In Folder](https://github.com/Simone3/Utils/raw/master/utils/Zip%20Files%20In%20Folder.jar): this util compresses a set of files in a configurable number of ZIP files.
- [Unwrap Text](https://github.com/Simone3/Utils/raw/master/utils/Unwrap%20Text.html): transforms a multi-line source text into a single-line target text.
